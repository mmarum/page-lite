    "about": "from the Boston Road Records album, Sands of Aberdeen - a true story -  the following was written for and publish in The Ceili Magazine. (c) Jed Marum, 2008 Crowbar Joe Uncle Joe and I had spent the better part of two weeks working together at a variety of excavation jobs around the towns of Sudbury, Concord and Wayland Massachusetts. I worked in those days for Joe's nephew Mike, operating a backhoe, shovel dozer and a dump truck. Joe had been around that summer for an extended visit - his first time to America and the first time in about 60 years that he'd seen his younger sister, Mike's mom. Uncle Joe was bo<br> and raised in the Midlands of Ireland. He had a story that was almost word for word the same as that of my great-grandfather. Joe said when he was 17 his father came to him and said \"Here is the fare to England, son; God Bless You!\" Since Joe had a number of younger brothers and sisters and the family was poor, he knew it meant the time had come for him to make his own way in the world. Now some 60 years later here was Joe in New England retelling the stories of a lifetime to me; a young man, a stranger eager to hear the tales of a life so different - but a life not unlike that of my own family. I listened. I was amazed at the hardships. I marveled at the challenges Joe had faced and I was in awe at the humor he had retained. Uncle Joe lived hand-to-mouth and labored at menial tasks throughout his life, building only to the level of day laborer in the streets of, first Liverpool and later London - and yet Joe had one of the sunniest dispositions and kindest hearts I'd ever known. He had married while in Liverpool, raised a family in London. His eldest daughter, now grown with a family of her own - had convinced him to find his sister and come to America to pay a visit. So they looked up Mike's mom, made contact and flew to Sudbury Massachusetts one summer for a holiday. That's how I met Uncle Joe.Mike ran a small excavation business out of his home and since Joe had worked as a hand laborer for many years, he found coming to work with Mike me more to his liking then doing the tourist things with his daughter and family. Joe would sit on the fender of my backhoe and we'd swap stories all mo<br>ing, get out the rake and shovel in the afte<br>oon or drop into the trench and lay pipe - or complete whatever tasks we had - all the while swapping stories. Joe reminded me of my father's uncles. I was young when they passed away but I still remembered the accents and the humor. I still remembered the stories and the light in their eyes when they sang their favorite songs. Joe had that same light, that same joy at remembering the good times and retelling the stories. He had that same love for music. I worked music in those days too; one or two nights a week at local pubs or restaurants. Shortly before they retu<br>ed home, Mike brought Uncle Joe and the family to one of the pubs I played regularly. \"Oh you played Spancil Hill and Wild Colonial Boy,\" Joe went on, the next day after visiting the Pub where I played. \"I always sing those songs back home. Then you played the harmonica. Oh I love the harmonica! I always wished I could lea<br> to play the harmonica,\" he went on and on. We talked more about some of our favorite songs and how much we loved music. All the while we were working on a new excavation project.This day Joe and I were laying in a new water service to an old building. The new pipe would run alongside the water main that supplied the town of Wayland. I spent a few hours carefully exposing 300 feet or so of the water main with the backhoe, and finishing the work by hand to be sure we didn't damage the pipe. The time came for us to connect the new pipe with the old so I dropped through a man-hole cover into the pit where the pipes would be joined. It was a simple matter; push one brick out of the cone-shaped well that made up the pit and then run a new line through the hole. I didn't need any help, but Uncle Joe wanted to give me a hand. \"I'm in the trench and I have the crowbar with me,\" he spoke from outside the pit. There was a short pause then excitedly I heard him say, \"OOops! We've got water comin' in!\"\"WHAT??\" I thought. I couldn't believe it! I'd spent hours carefully, painstakingly uncovering the water main so as to be sure it was not damaged. How did this \"leak\" suddenly appear?? I climbed out of the pit just in time to see the sandy soil of the trench falling in around Joe's feet as he hopped out the hole. Water pouring up from the main and had already bubbled up high over his ankles, reaching almost to his knees by the time he got out.\"What in the heck happened?\" I wondered to myself, but didn't speak because Joe was looking a bit guilty. The water department fellows were close at hand, as they always are when work is being done on their pipe, so they quickly shut down the main supply and stopped the flood. But that meant they'd shut down the entire water supply for the whole town of Wayland and several other towns just west of Boston. This was looking like a costly and troublesome error! Once the water was shut off and we'd drained the trench, I was able to see that a nice neat, dime-sized hole had been punched into the top of the pipe. It seemed obvious to me that the hole was precisely the size of the crowbar tip. And it tu<br>ed out that because the hole was small and neat, we were lucky. We'd be able to fit a patch onto the pipe - a high tech, expensive patch, to be sure - but it was much less costly and disruptive then having to replace a section of water main. We had the pipe fixed and operational within a half an hour. Nephew Mike was not happy, of course, about spending five or six hundred dollars to patch a hole that his Uncle Joe had accidentally punched into the water main - but it was a lot better then several thousand dollars that a full scale repair would have cost. We counted our blessings!After hours, that day we stopped for a beer at Mike's favorite local and Joe told us the full story, \"I jumped into the pit to help Jed make the connection,\" He said, \"but when I dropped the crowbar, it bounced off the side of the trench and landed directly on the top of the water main.\" Joe admitted the error sheepishly but by now we could all get a good laugh about it. Still, that was it for Mike. He stopped calling Joe, Uncle Joe and started calling him Crowbar Joe and the name stuck for the rest of the visit. Joe and his family were scheduled to head back home a few days after this incident, so I stopped at the music store and bought a harmonica for Joe as a going away gift. He and I were finishing work on a new roadway we'd made for a golf course along the Sudbury River when I gave Joe the harmonica. I was totally amazed at his response. You'd think I'd given him a string of pearls! Tears ran down his cheeks. He walked away a few steps, trying it out; blowing in, drawing back, moving up and down the row of holes - then he ran back over to me and gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. He was just so touched at \"such a thoughtful gift\" as he said, and he \"really was going to lea<br> to play it, too!\"I spent a few minutes explaining the basics of \"harmonica music theory\" and then Joe worked at it. He worked at it all afte<br>oon and he really was finding a few melodies before long. He really was lea<br>ing to play.So many years have passed since I said goodbye to Uncle Joe. I'd always remembered his stories and his way with the truth. I'd always remembered his kind heart and his joyous spirit in a world; that, toward him had not been all that kind. One day just a few months ago I was sitting at home playing with a new melody and Joe popped into my mind. A few hours later I had my new favorite song. A song I simply call, Uncle Joe. I hope the song pays homage to a lovely old man who gave a wide eyed young man some great stories and a few hours worth living.",
